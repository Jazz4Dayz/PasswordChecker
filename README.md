# PasswordChecker
Password requirements:
+ at least 1 alpha char
+ at least 1 numeric char
+ at least 1 special car
+ at least 8 chars long
- no spaces
- can't start with "!" or "?"

NOTE: For this assignment I also had to include functions
which tell the user which violations they've made.

P.S. I know these aren't practical requirements for in real life but
these are the requirements my teacher gave me, so they had to be followed.
Hopefully this will help anyone else out who may get the same project
with similar requirements. I'm just very glad I finally got it to
workd as perfectly as it does!
